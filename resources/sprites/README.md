Most of the art that I'm using is placeholder, so I'm very grateful to all the people who put out free game assets that I can use.

Depending on how far I get with this, I may make/commission custom art for the game.

## Eggs

By [taarna23](https://taarna23.itch.io)

Available here: [https://taarna23.itch.io/1000-egg-sprites](https://taarna23.itch.io/1000-egg-sprites)

Free tier available. I've purchased the top tier of this pack, because they're pretty great, but license is currently unspecified.

About the only art I'm using that I'm actually happy with.
